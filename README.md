# PolygonDrawer
Simple WPF app, allowing user to draw polygons and add relations between edges.

There are 3 methods for drawing edges:
 - Bresenham algorithm
 - Symmetrical Bresenham algorithm
 - Library function

There are two types of relations between edges:
 - equality
 - perpendicularity
 
Relations are supposed to sustain, when moving vertices or edges.
